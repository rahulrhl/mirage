Todo list while I make some updates..

## To Do
* Remove rain percentage (it's shite).
* Add 'last updated' for things.
* Log to a file and make a page show it?
* Change bus numbers to bus stops (so it works like a real bus stop display).
* Reliability.
* Local countdown of times

## Done
* Make messages configurable.
